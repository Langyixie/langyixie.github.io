<h2>What is Mercedes-AMG?</h2>
<p>In an old mill in 1967, two automotive engineers with a passion for motorsports began turning Mercedes-Benz sedans into winning racecars. Today, as the performance division of Mercedes-Benz, AMG continues to create victory on the track and desire on the streets of the world. Every Mercedes-AMG vehicle is the product of craftsmen, designers and engineers who live to test limits and live by a singular mantra: Driving Performance.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>A LINEUP OF SUPERSTARS. A FAMILY OF THOROUGHBREDS.</h2>
<p>From the creators of the 45, 63 and 65 model lines comes Mercedesâ€‘AMG 43, nine authentic performance vehicles with AMG pedigree and a thirst for speed. Fitted with numerous AMG enhancements, every vehicle screams "Drive me," because in the AMG family, performance is king. From coupes and sedans to SUVs and roadsters, the power and handling of the 43 lineup beckon to the world's most passionate drivers. All that's left to do is grip the wheel and press the accelerator. </p>
