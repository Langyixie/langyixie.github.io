<h2 id="What is Mercedes-AMG?">What is Mercedes-AMG?</h2>
<p>In an old mill in 1967, two automotive engineers with a passion for motorsports began turning Mercedes-Benz sedans into winning racecars. Today, as the performance division of Mercedes-Benz, AMG continues to create victory on the track and desire on the streets of the world. Every Mercedes-AMG vehicle is the product of craftsmen, designers and engineers who live to test limits and live by a singular mantra: Driving Performance.</p>

<h2> Mercedes-Benz “Concept IAA”: digital transformer. </h2>
<p> The Mercedes-Benz “Concept IAA” (Intelligent Aerodynamic Automobile) is two cars in one: an aerodynamics world champion with a Cd value of 0.19 and a four-door coupé embodying irresistible design. The study, which is celebrating its world premiere at the IAA Cars 2015, switches automatically from design mode to aerodynamic mode when the vehicle reaches a speed of 80 km/h, whereby numerous aerodynamics measures alter the shape of the vehicle. Inside, the “Concept IAA” continues the design line of the S-Class and S-Class Coupé and offers new touch-based functions.
