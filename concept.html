At Mercedes-Benz, we believe the future of driving means giving the customer the option to not have to drive at all. With the F 015 Luxury in Motion, the vehicle drives itself, transforming the cabin into a personal haven where time and space are the ultimate luxury.

The exterior features a low-slung front end and a smooth, streamlined roof, which gives the F 015 Luxury in Motion a dynamic silhouette, while the innovative saloon-style doors provide easy access to the interior lounge.

There you´ll find four rotating seats that allow face-to-face configuration, as well as six display screens harmoniously built into the front, rear and side panels. It´s a digital arena that allows passengers to interact with the vehicle through gestures, eye tracking and high-res touch-screens. The walnut trim and soft nappa leather merge with the metal and glass to form a truly luxurious experience.

It´s a bold foray into the future of driving, where the car is more than a simple means of transportation. It´s a personal retreat, both spacious and seamless. The F 015 Luxury in Motion is a vehicle that redefines the word.</p>
